	Annote = {In his recent blog post, Chris Olah describe a special model of recurrent neural networks known as LSTM Networks, or Long Short-Term Memory Networks. He describes the significant advances that recurrent neural networks made over "vanilla" (or non-recurrent) neural networks by allowing information to persist within the model. Theoretically, RNNs should be able to draw on information from previous decisions to make its current one, but in practice they have only proven effective when the distance between the relevant past information and the time frame in which it is required is small. LSTMs solved this problem by altering the structure of the network's hidden activation layers to create a pipeline of persisting information and a series of control gates for allowing new information to enter the pipeline.

This blog post is aimed at machine learning researching with a general understanding of neural networks and are seeking a more visual and approachable introduction to LSTMs. While a young author, Chris is a highly accomplished researcher and engineer in the field, and his explanations are concise, descriptive, and well-researched, citing several relevant papers. },

@article{madsen2002,
	Annote = {This report represents a fairly standard approach to the task of automatic harmonization of Bach chorales. Given the melody of a chorale, the authors developed a neural network to provide harmonic support for each note in the melody, which has been abstracted to series a quarter notes for the sake of evenly distributed time frames. Input features include past and previous elements of the melody, previously determined harmonies, and contextual elements of the current soprano note, such as beat strength. After experimenting with several different data representations for the feature vectors, they discovered a relatively effective solution when they represented the output vector as a range of MIDI notes from which the alto, tenor, and bass voices were selected.

This paper is also somewhat dated and doesn't provide an adequate explanation of their neural network construction. However, their method is preprocessing (that is, abstracting chorales into quarter-note time frames) is intruiging and likely to be used in my initial experiments with RNNs.  },

For each method (i.e. systems that learn, grammars, etc.), the major attempts using this methodology are examined, and then the authors provide a list of advantages and disvantages to exploring the approach further. They mention several past approaches taken to the task of harmonization - as a satisfaction constraint problem, as a generative grammar, or as a learn-by-example approach using machine learning.

This paper was written at the turn of the century and therefore lacks some of the more recent research on harmonization using sophisticated neural networks. However, it remains useful as a well-sourced appendix of attempts at automatic harmonization using a variety of computational models. The extensive bibliography will also come in handy for future research.},

@article{petri1995bebop,
	Abstract = {In cognitive science and research on artificial intelligence, there are two central paradigms: symbolic and analogical. Within the analogical paradigm, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have recently been successfully used to model and simulate cognitive phenomena. One of the most prominent features of ANNs is their ability to learn by example and, to a certain extent, generalize what they have learned. Improvisation, the art of spontaneously creating music while playing or singing, fundamentally has an imitative nature. Regardless of how much one studies and analyzes, the art of improvisation is learned mostly by example. Instead of memorizing explicit rules, the student mimics the playing of other musicians. This kind of learning procedure cannot be easily modeled with rule- based symbolic systems. ANNs, on the other hand, provide an effective means of modeling and simulating this kind of imitative learning. In this article, a model of jazz improvisation that is based on supervised learning ANNs is described. Some results, achieved by simulations with the model, are presented. The simulations show that the model is able to apply the material it has learned in a new context. It can even create new melodic patterns based on the learned patterns. This kind of adaptability is a direct consequence of the fact that the knowledge resides in a distributed form in the network.},
	Annote = {Petri Toivainen presents an artificial neural network (ANN) that given a series of chord changes is able to improvise over them in a jazz bebop style. The target-note technique describes provides signposts at the beginning of each chord change, giving the ANN targets with which to arrive at using a series of melodic patterns. The result is a suprisingly decent melodic improvisation given a small training set - consisting of Clifford Brown's solos on "All the Things You Are" and "Getrude's Bounce".Toivainen's paper is an early example of a computational approach to jazz composition.},

@mastersthesis{thorpe1998bach,
	Annote = {Unlike many past and future attempts, Chris Thorpe's A.B. thesis explores the task of harmonizing Bach chorales with a bass line rather than a complete set of voices. He uses Markov chains to model the harmonization task, representating a harmony at time T as a given "state" that can transition to any one of a set of other harmonies, in each case with a pre-determined probability of that transition occurring. Thorpe models harmonization in this form as a "completive" rather than generative task, in that the produced bass line is one of a set of valid options.

This paper is one of the most notable Harvard undergraduate theses in Computer Science and Music. Thorpe is forthcoming about his methodology and the reasoning behind it, while also acknowledging the limitations of a Markov-based approach.
