# J.S. BOT: Exploring Computational Harmonic Analysis and Prediction in the Bach Chorales

## Excerpt from the abstract:

The Baroque composer J.S. Bach harmonized over 300 chorale melodies over his lifetime, which today remain a pivotal body of music in the history of Western music and exemplify Bach's groundbreaking compositional techniques. Bach's harmonizations establish a series of compositional conventions that musicians today continue to emulate in order to learn 4-part counterpoint. By transforming the Chorales into a numerical dataset, this thesis examines the ability of a variety of machine learning models to learn perform harmonic analysis over the chorale melodies as well as generate new and stylistically appropriate harmonizations.
