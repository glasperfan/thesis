@article{greff2015lstm,
	Abstract = {Several variants of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for recurrent neural networks have been proposed since its inception in 1995. In recent years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models for a variety of machine learning problems. This has led to a renewed interest in understanding the role and utility of various computational components of typical LSTM variants. In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants on three representative tasks: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized separately using random search and their importance was assessed using the powerful fANOVA framework. In total, we summarize the results of 5400 experimental runs (about 15 years of CPU time), which makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly, and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its most critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters are virtually independent and derive guidelines for their efficient adjustment.},

	Annote = {In his recent blog post, Chris Olah describe a special model of recurrent neural networks known as LSTM Networks, or Long Short-Term Memory Networks. He describes the significant advances that recurrent neural networks made over "vanilla" (or non-recurrent) neural networks by allowing information to persist within the model. Theoretically, RNNs should be able to draw on information from previous decisions to make its current one, but in practice they have only proven effective when the distance between the relevant past information and the time frame in which it is required is small. LSTMs solved this problem by altering the structure of the network's hidden activation layers to create a pipeline of persisting information and a series of control gates for allowing new information to enter the pipeline.

This blog post is aimed at machine learning researching with a general understanding of neural networks and are seeking a more visual and approachable introduction to LSTMs. While a young author, Chris is a highly accomplished researcher and engineer in the field, and his explanations are concise, descriptive, and well-researched, citing several relevant papers. },

	Annote = {This report represents a fairly standard approach to the task of automatic harmonization of Bach chorales. Given the melody of a chorale, the authors developed a neural network to provide harmonic support for each note in the melody, which has been abstracted to series a quarter notes for the sake of evenly distributed time frames. Input features include past and previous elements of the melody, previously determined harmonies, and contextual elements of the current soprano note, such as beat strength. After experimenting with several different data representations for the feature vectors, they discovered a relatively effective solution when they represented the output vector as a range of MIDI notes from which the alto, tenor, and bass voices were selected.

This paper is also somewhat dated and doesn't provide an adequate explanation of their neural network construction. However, their method is preprocessing (that is, abstracting chorales into quarter-note time frames) is intruiging and likely to be used in my initial experiments with RNNs.  },

@article{petri1995bebop,
	Abstract = {In cognitive science and research on artificial intelligence, there are two central paradigms: symbolic and analogical. Within the analogical paradigm, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have recently been successfully used to model and simulate cognitive phenomena. One of the most prominent features of ANNs is their ability to learn by example and, to a certain extent, generalize what they have learned. Improvisation, the art of spontaneously creating music while playing or singing, fundamentally has an imitative nature. Regardless of how much one studies and analyzes, the art of improvisation is learned mostly by example. Instead of memorizing explicit rules, the student mimics the playing of other musicians. This kind of learning procedure cannot be easily modeled with rule- based symbolic systems. ANNs, on the other hand, provide an effective means of modeling and simulating this kind of imitative learning. In this article, a model of jazz improvisation that is based on supervised learning ANNs is described. Some results, achieved by simulations with the model, are presented. The simulations show that the model is able to apply the material it has learned in a new context. It can even create new melodic patterns based on the learned patterns. This kind of adaptability is a direct consequence of the fact that the knowledge resides in a distributed form in the network.},
	Annote = {Petri Toivainen presents an artificial neural network (ANN) that given a series of chord changes is able to improvise over them in a jazz bebop style. The target-note technique describes provides signposts at the beginning of each chord change, giving the ANN targets with which to arrive at using a series of melodic patterns. The result is a suprisingly decent melodic improvisation given a small training set - consisting of Clifford Brown's solos on "All the Things You Are" and "Getrude's Bounce".Toivainen's paper is an early example of a computational approach to jazz composition.},

@mastersthesis{thorpe1998bach,
	Annote = {Unlike many past and future attempts, Chris Thorpe's A.B. thesis explores the task of harmonizing Bach chorales with a bass line rather than a complete set of voices. He uses Markov chains to model the harmonization task, representating a harmony at time T as a given "state" that can transition to any one of a set of other harmonies, in each case with a pre-determined probability of that transition occurring. Thorpe models harmonization in this form as a "completive" rather than generative task, in that the produced bass line is one of a set of valid options.

This paper is one of the most notable Harvard undergraduate theses in Computer Science and Music. Thorpe is forthcoming about his methodology and the reasoning behind it, while also acknowledging the limitations of a Markov-based approach.

However, a subset of RNNs labeled LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) have shown much greater promise due to their ability to retain information about decisions in previous time frames. With respect to music generation, the authors demonstrate its ability to successfully learn a 12-bar blues form and improvise melodies over those harmonies.},
